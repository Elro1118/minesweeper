# Minesweeper

My goal was to build a minesweeper game using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios">Axios</a>, <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">Javascript</a>,  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5">Html</a>, and  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">CSS3</a> as programming languages. I hope you enjoy this game, and its link is https://minesweeper-Elro1118.netlify.com

, , <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">API</a>

I am proud of this project because it challenged my skills as a software developer.
